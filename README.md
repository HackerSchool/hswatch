## Objective

This project aims to create a _diy_ smartwatch, open-source and programable using Arduino code style, so that hobbyists, students and hackers can contribute to this project and design their own smartwatch according to their tastes. Besides the watch it self this project also contains an Android companion app source code, that is also extendable so that the watch can accomodate more features.

## Features 

This are the features that are already implemented:
- Show a clock (hours, minutes, seconds, day, month, year, week day) regularly syncronized with the smartphone clock.
- Mirror notifications from the smartphone to the watch screen, vibrating each time a new one is received.
- Show notification history, blinking a RGB LED each time there is an unread message. (The LED blinks a diferent color for diferent types of notifications)
- Measure battery charge level of the smartwatch and show it on the main screen.
- Three adjustable alarm clocks. This alarms sound a buzzer and vibrate the watch.
- Stop watch and timer.
- Show 6 days weather forecast on watch screen, using the smartphone companion app as a gateway to online weather services.

The software was made to be easily extendable, feel free to add more features.
